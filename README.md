## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

HTML was used to structure the content of the webpage, including adding the necessary input fields for the user to enter the date.

CSS was used to style the webpage, including formatting the layout, fonts, colors, and other design elements. This helped to create an engaging and visually appealing user interface.

JavaScript was used to handle the interaction between the user and the NASA API. It was used to capture the user's input, send requests to the NASA API, and display the returned data on the webpage.

Overall, my project was made using a combination of these front-end technologies, with the aim of creating an informative and engaging web application for users to explore space-related content from NASA's archives.

## Description
My NASA API project allows users to input a specific date, and then generates an image, name, and description associated with that day. By utilizing NASA's API, I am able to pull relevant information and images from their extensive database of space-related content.

Upon entering a date, my project sends a request to the NASA API and receives a response containing information about that specific day. The image associated with the day is then displayed on the page, along with the name and a brief description of the image.

This project is not only informative, but also visually appealing. Users are able to explore and learn about different aspects of space, from NASA's archives, and engage with the content through a simple and intuitive interface.

Overall, my NASA API project provides an accessible and engaging way for users to learn about space-related content, and serves as a testament to the power of utilizing APIs to create informative and engaging applications.

## Lessons Learned:

Overall, developing a NASA API project provides a great opportunity to learn new skills and practice important development concepts, while creating an engaging and informative application for users.
